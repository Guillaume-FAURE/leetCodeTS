# LeetCode challenges TypeScript

This is a repository with all the challenges I made from the website : https://leetcode.com/problems There all made in
TypeScript with a little test in a main function. For more completed test, use the leetcode website.  
There is sometimes additional code for alternative solutions or alternative problem solved.  
There is also sometimes some console.log to help the understanding and test of the code, remove them for better scores.

The pourcentage next to runtime and memory is how faster and how less memory the program used compare to other
typescript program. The runtime, memory and pourcentage can be variable over time and even with multiple consecutive
uses of the programs.
